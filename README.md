ðŸŽ¥ YouTube Video Summarizer using OpenAI & Streamlit
This project is a lightweight, AI-powered web app that allows you to summarize YouTube videos instantly using OpenAI's GPT model. Whether you're a student, researcher, or just trying to save time, this tool helps you extract key points from long videos in seconds.

It uses the YouTube Transcript API to fetch subtitles.

The transcript is sent to OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o model along with a smart prompt.

The model returns a concise, readable summary in the selected language.

The summary is enhanced with highlighted keywords, formatted neatly, and offered for download as a PDF.
